## This repo contain three different solution to solve the Knapsack Problem.

**Presentation of the problem**

The problem is to find the maximum value of a subset of items that can be put in a knapsack of capacity W.

**Presentation of the three different solutions**

 1. The first solution called "greedy" use a greedy algorithm which sorts objects by a value/weight ratio and put the most valuable one first.

 2. The second solution called "best" use a Dynamic programming algorithm which uses a matrix that stores the solutions as they occur

 3. The third solution called "optimal" use a Brut force algorithm which tests all possible combinations

**Presentation of all the code requirements**

The code is written in Python 3.10

The code meets the PEP8 standard

All the algorithm has an A with radon

The code is tested with the test_knapsack.py file

I have left all the branchs of the pull requests on purpose so that I can show the development cycle.
Our teachers ask us to leave them. **Sorry for the purists :(**
