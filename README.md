## This repo contain three different solution to solve the Knapsack Problem.

### **Presentation of the problem**

#### The problem is to find the maximum value of a subset of items that can be put in a knapsack of capacity W.

### **Presentaion of the three different solution**

#### The first solution called "greedy" use a greedy algorithm which sorts the objects value/weight

#### The second solution called "best" use a Dynamic programming algorithm which uses a matrix that stores the solutions as they occur

#### The third solution called "optimal" use a Brut force algorithm which tests all possible combinations

### **Presentation of all the code requirements**

#### The code is written in Python 3.10

#### The code meets the PEP8 standard

#### All the algorithm have an A with radon
