### This repo contain three different solution to solve the Knapsack Problem.

#### The code is written in Python 3.10

#### The first solution called "greedy" use a greedy algorithm which sorts the objects value/weight

#### The second solution called "best" use a Dynamic programming algorithm which uses a matrix that stores the solutions as they occur

#### The third solution called "optimal" use a Brut force algorithm which tests all possible combinations

### The code meets the PEP8 standard

## All the algorithm have an A with radon

## The code is tested with the test_knapsack.py file

### This project was made during a course of Advanced algorithms at the University of Paris
